# HiAccess

## A parallel processing model for accelerating high-resolution geo-spatial accessibility analysis.

We present a parallel processing model, named HiAccess, to solve the high-resolution accessibility analysis problems in real time. One feature of HiAccess is a fast road network construction method, in which the road network topology is determined by traversing the original road nodes only once. The parallel strategies of HiAccess are fully optimized through theoretical analysis and experimental comparisons. Moreover, map generalization techniques are adopted to reduce computation load without accuracy loss. The flexibility of HiAccess enables it to work well when applied to different accessibility analysis models. To further demonstrate the applicability of HiAccess, a case study of settlement sites selection for poverty alleviation in Xiangxi, Central China, is carried out. The accessibility of jobs, health care, educational resources and other public facilities are comprehensively analyzed for settlement sites selection. HiAccess demonstrates the striking performance of measuring high-resolution (using 100m Ã— 100m grids) accessibility of a city (in total over 250k grids, roads with 232k segments, 40 facilities) in 1 second without preprocessing, while ArcGIS takes nearly 1 hour to achieve a less satisfactory result. In additional experiments, HiAccess is tested on much larger datasets with excellent performance.
